------------------------
version : 2.0  
DIRAC release : v6r11p6  
Date : 15 Jul 2014  

- global temporary file handler change to dict()  
- do not delele-recreate remote file if there is no modification (cat, more, 
  less, tail)  
- added mount option : -o SE=<dirac storage element>  
- file/directory access permission sync  

commands compatibility:  
  mv : - globaly works for files, for directory better to copy to local then  
         copy to remote path and delete local copy (fuse/fuse-python bug?)  
       - cannot overwrite existing file in same directory : dirac GUID  
  vi(vim, gvim) : work although better to set swap file/directory to local 
                  path  
  emacs : work as vi  
  cp [-r]  
  stat  
  chmod [-R]  
  rsync
